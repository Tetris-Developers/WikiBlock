# WikiBlock

A wiki for Block-Stacking game developers. Here you will be able to see a lot of infos you could need in order to build your own Block-Stacking game, especially the infos you can't find on [the Harddrop wiki](https://harddrop.com/wiki/Tetris_Wiki). The wiki is made for collaboration, so do not hesitate to add your knowledge in it (just make a pull request on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Tetris-Developers/WikiBlock)).

The wiki is currently almost empty. Please take some time to create wiki pages, it will help a lot ;).
